# Multiplication-of-
A program which uses dynamic memory allocation for reserving memory for two matrix variables, initializes them randomly and calculates their multiplication and prints the result to the standard output. The program must set the dimensions of matrixes randomly during run-time and make sure that multiplication operation is possible for matrixes with generated dimensions.
